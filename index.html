    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Christian Olivo, as you can see I have atleast 10+ years of
      overall work expirience that include customer service, manual labor,
      sales, and retail. I believe in the phrase,"hard work pays off" because I
      am a living testament of how hard work has given me the self dicipline to
      stay commited to my goals and dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of hopes and dreams I currently am a student participating in
      Dr.Angela Yu's "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" online Udemy
      12-week course. I believe I will be a core asset Software Engineer for a
      compamy in the near future.
